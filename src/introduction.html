Activating alleyways is a movement to renovate public spaces that have been overlooked and neglected. These alleys are transformed from dark, dirty and less than pleasant public spaces into enjoyable and exciting new places for the public to discover. In a society that is continuously growing, there is a demand for more and better public spaces to enjoy. Activated alleys often become a feature and a destination for people, which benefits visitors, residents and nearby businesses. </p>

<p>
A baseline study of the alleys around the two downtown areas of Palo Alto was performed the fall semester of 2015 by geography students from San Jose State University. This project of creating a design plan for how alleys around California Avenue can be activated is a continuation of that study. The study area in the baseline study of California Avenue goes from El Camino Real to the Caltrain Station and from New Mayfield Lane to Jacaranda Lane. A new public safety building and a new parking garage is planned for two areas that are parking lots today, area C-6 and C-7. These lots are located one block south of California Avenue, between Birch Street and Park Street. The new Public Safety building will be built on lot C-6. In the plans for this new building, they have planned for extra space for pedestrians in the direction towards California. The pedestrian alley that is located between 261 California Avenue and 249 California Avenue let people take a shortcut from California Avenue to the planned new Public Safety building. Therefore the design plan created in this project is planned for this particular pedestrian alley. The same alley has been proposed as a possible site for future art installation in the Public Art in Alley Project, as a part of the Public Art Master Plan, by the name: “Park Blvd 1”.

From the survey results gathered in the baseline study, we learned that most people find the alleys around California Avenue downtown safe and clean. The alleys are mostly used by pedestrians and it is key that these alleys are turned into inviting human-centered spaces. The recommendations for activation ranges from naming the alleys, to adding decorative features and including architectural features in the design plan.
