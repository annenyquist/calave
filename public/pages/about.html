I would first like to thank the City of Palo Alto and Matthew Krupp for the exciting opportunity to undertake this project.
</p>

<p>
In addition, my advisor, Ph. D. Kerry Rohrmeier of the Geography and Global Studies Department at San Jose State University, has been invaluable in her role and has always been available to support and help me with any issue that needed to be resolved.

<p>
Finally, I must express my gratitude to my husband and to my parents for their support and encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This achievement would not have been possible without them.
