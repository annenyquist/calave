Alleyways in major cities across the United States and around the world are trendy targets for activation - an effort to re-create these spaces for safety and comfort and to provide unique urban environments offering respite from bustling downtown landscapes. Most existing literature on activated alleyways is policy focused or design oriented, offering guidelines that specify desired public capital improvements. As significant scholarly urban planning and geography literature has yet to be published on this relatively new topic, relevant background research has been included, especially as it relates to the necessity of alleys for disposal of the remnants of mass consumption.
</p>

<h2 id="scholarly-review">Scholarly Literature</h2>

<p>
Culturally, Giles Slade (2006) wrote about disposability as the precursor to innovation and the evolution of obsolescence. These concepts originated with technological advances such as the replacement of wood stoves by electric appliances and progressed sharply when “obsolete” came to mean “no longer in fashion.” Making new goods necessary or something to be manipulated through marketing, coupled with efficiencies in natural resource exploitation and manufacturing, American consumers transformed their nation’s economy into one of mass consumption and made it necessary for American cities to retrofit narrow corridors between buildings to facilitate waste disposal.
</p>

<p>
Waste space was reinforced through the encouraged use of disposable products, thus perpetuating habitual disposal in consumer behavior and to a lesser degree the recycling or composting of society’s unwanted things. Further fueled by a new postwar mobility and convenience, this led to the genesis of fast food, delivery, or carryout options providing customers with meals to eat whose packaging is then discarded. Much of the packaging and disposable goods that come with fast food are made of plastic, which does not break down in the environment but remains there for decades (Brown 2015). Organic decomposition may take decades in a landfill, but some food packaging waste will persist forever (Brown 2015).
</p>

<p>
If disposability is an American invention, then alleys have an ignored cultural significance. These sites reveal the sad daily cycle of waste departure. What was once part of something “good” is now temporarily awaiting haul-off to its final terminus - the municipal landfill. These items are often placed adjacent to new arrivals of that which is a better, or fresher, replacement. From a retail standpoint, alleys in this regard might become an urban artifact necessary to be repurposed through activation, before becoming discarded sites themselves, reminiscent of the changing tides toward e-commerce and technology’s residential demand-to-doorstep revolution.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that bringing people, in place of waste bins, to alleys is not a modern idea or phenomenon. The hurdle today is overcoming fear. According to Kevin Wang and Ralph Taylor (2006), alleys were more populated places in the late nineteenth through mid- twentieth centuries until urban renewal and mass postwar suburbanization left alleys as depopulated spaces. With empirical evidence from simple surveys, Wang and Taylor observed perceived fear among respondents asked to describe their feelings while walking through an imaginary alley at night. As expected, fear correlated with distance traveled from either the start or end of the alley corridor.
</p>

<p>
Fear is one of the strongest human emotions. While in this state, one’s central nervous system activates fight or flight instincts whereby senses become increasingly alert and one becomes more aware of one’s surroundings - consciously and unconsciously. It is natural to fear crime or to be afraid of criminals engaged in illegal behavior, and the commission of undesirable actions rarely occurs in broad daylight or open public plazas. Instead, crime takes place where low exposure risks exist, such as dark alley spaces or behind large, odorous waste bins, as these uninviting places provide a false sense of security. Cities, tasked to serve and protect the public, are interested in new approaches to reduce crime. As Rachel Pain (2000) explained, the current policy arena is shifting toward a holistic approach over formerly localized measures because in certain environments people generally report fear of losses to person and property. Uncared-for places characterized as dark, unmonitored, and vacant, alleys certainly fit within this profile. Where physical aspects of fear-inducing spaces have been the main focus, researchers have termed this “designed out,” referring to the possibility for urban design to prevent dark, unclean, and abandoned environments.
</p>

<p>
Situational approaches to fear reduction gained political popularity during the conservative 1980s, but longitudinal research findings yielded mixed results. For example, lighting might not help if the only people watching are criminals or if improved lighting highlights disorderly conditions. However, if a comprehensive design is context specific (such as if this same dark alley receives better lighting plus security cameras) then it might dissuade fear (Pain 2000). Planners, urban designers, and architects are discovering that relationships between physical space and social psychogeographic dimensions are complex and that multi-scalar strategies striving to improve, or activate, places where unwanted activities take place may be the best alternative.

Jane Jacobs, Jan Gehl, and William Whyte have all been influential in the urban planning community and their work is used as an alternative to modernism and traditional planning theory. These theorists studied street life and worked to determine how public spaces that are constantly in use and buzzing with life can be created. Many of the findings of these theorists can be applied to alleys as well as the types of public spaces that have been studied.
</p>

<p>
Jan Gehl studied people and what they do during an ordinary day while spending their time in the streets and plazas of a city. He studied how people commute, do their daily chores, as well as how they spend free time in public spaces, and how all these tasks are interwoven in the same space (Gehl 2011). Life between buildings can be described as a self-reinforcing process because people like to join in or watch activities in which other people are already participating. Urban planning can make a difference in the possibility of people meeting, seeing, and hearing each other, which is the important background for other forms of contact. Gehl stated that one of the reasons he conducted the study of life between buildings was that these kinds of activities are some of the most important qualities of public space. Making sure that there is room for all kinds of activities, not just recreation or pedestrian traffic, helps create meaningful and attractive public spaces (Gehl 2011). The need for stimulation is another important part of the process of creating life between buildings. Gehl stated that exciting cities are rich in experiences and contact with other people. Having the chance to interact with others provides an enticing opportunity for memorable experiences (Gehl 2011). The life that goes on between buildings is both more relevant and more interesting to look at in the long run than any architecturally interesting buildings (Gehl 2011). It is life on the street level that seems to create interest among other people, not the buildings themselves (Gehl 2011). According to Gehl, buildings that are low and placed close together, pedestrian friendly, offer great outdoor spaces, and have close proximity to residences, public buildings, and workplaces are likely to promote a thriving public space (Gehl 2011). Five principles were formulated for creating contact between people in a public space: no walls, short distances, low traffic speeds, one level, and orientation toward others (Gehl 2011).

Jane Jacobs is known for her criticism of current city planning and rebuilding. In her work, she has described what makes a good city and introduced new principles of urban planning (Jacobs 1992). Jacobs claimed that these principles are not only different, but also even opposite from the theory which was common at the time the book was written. Jacobs also stated that it is important to study everyday life to understand the principles of planning and the practices of rebuilding. The importance of social and economic vitality is stressed in her work. Jacobs is also concerned with how the city works, not just how it looks, and because most people have normal lives, studying them will help with finding out how cities work. Jane Jacobs’ most important point on how to create better cities involves the need for diversity (Jacobs 1992, 151). She has come up with four points on how to create diversity. The first point is that as long as it is possible, each part of the city should have more than one primary function, and preferably more than two. The purpose of having multiple functionalities is to ensure that people come and go at different times of the day, but still are using the same facilities (Jacobs 1992). The second point is about the size of city blocks. According to Jacobs, they should be as small as possible. Small blocks provide more opportunities to choose a route from start to destination. Next, the buildings should vary in size, age, and condition. Last, a certain population density is needed. The concentration of people may be workers who commute to and from the district or residents who live in the district permanently (Jacobs 1992). Each city will have different possibilities for implementation of these four points, but working toward them should help all cities reach their potential. Jacobs makes it clear that working toward these conditions applies to regular shops and businesses such as schools, community centers, galleries, and restaurants, and not extravagant amenities like Finnish saunas and custom hat makers. Even the absence of one of the conditions may result in a city not living up to its potential, so all four are necessary to achieve the best possible result (Jacobs 1992).

William Whyte studied plazas and open spaces in New York City through the Street Life Project. The goal of this study was to find out why some plazas are popular and what can be done to achieve a great social life in other plazas. The results of this research were brought to the city administration as suggestions for how to improve public plazas. Whyte was particularly interested in how urban design decisions can be used to draw people to a certain space and how people interact when they are in this space. Like Gehl, Whyte’s research has shown that people are attracted to areas where people are already gathered. Whyte (2001) developed what he called the basics of a successful urban street life. These basics are sitting space, a food vendor, and a heavy pedestrian flow. According to Whyte’s research, these basics help draw people to plazas. Other important and helpful factors also contribute to creating a thriving social life in public spaces. Whyte stated: “The relationship to the street is integral, and it is far and away the critical design factor” (Whyte 2001). This means that plazas and streets have much in common. They should blend seamlessly together, and this can be the key to their success or failure. Whyte recommended that it should be difficult to distinguish where the street ends and the plaza starts (Whyte 2001). The experience of the park and the knowledge that it is there become a part of the image we have of a much larger area (Whyte 2001). The knowledge of a place’s existence is important because if the people do not know it is there, they will naturally not use it. People are drawn to visually interesting features, and retail stores with exciting window displays make people stop for a closer look, and that makes them a part of creating important street life. Seating is also an important part of the research (Whyte 2001, 27). If benches or chairs are not available, people will often sit on steps or ledges as long as the height or width of the seat is not too uncomfortable (Whyte 2001, 31-32). Shifting weather conditions is an issue in New York, and people like to have the possibility of choosing to sit in the sun or the shade depending on the temperature. Whyte suggested that it is possible to use sun and wind studies to make plazas less exposed to the elements and thereby more comfortable (Whyte 2001). Public spaces like this are mostly considered to be either outdoors or indoors, but Whyte recommended that knowledge about the sun and wind can be used to create more in-between spaces. Trees are a popular feature in streets and, combined with seating, they provide shaded sitting areas. Gehl (2011) found that people also like water features. Water is pretty to look at, and people can wade in suitable fountains to cool off in the summers.

<h2 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h2>

<p>
Australian cities such as Sydney and Melbourne appear to be the heart of the activated alleyways movement. Sydney started “The Laneway Revitalization Program” in 2008 by investing substantial funds to activate alleyways (City of Sydney 2015). Melbourne holds an annual “Love Your Laneway” contest, selecting five alleys to revitalize based on high-density criteria and local resident and business owner interest (City of Melbourne 2015). For the sake of this study, cases more akin to the City of Palo Alto have been selected.
</p>

<h3 id="san-francisco">San Francisco, California</h3>

<p>
In early 2015, the City of San Francisco Planning and Public Works Department released its “Market Octavia Living Alleys Toolkit,” which is part of a two-year plan to develop activated, pedestrianized, and greened streets to support environmentally sustainable functions with an emphasis on community and social engagements. The toolkit outlines steps from project kickoff to funding to implementation with the vision of being a source of inspiration for community members and designers elsewhere in the city. Through a series of public workshops, goals for “green,” “shared,” “vibrant,” and “clean and safe” were identified. “Green” was further defined as landscaping incorporated to soften the area, “shared” for prioritization of pedestrians and bicyclists, “recreation” for community use for temporary events or spontaneous activity to create vibrancy, and “clean and safe” meaning well-lit spaces for the enjoyment of all users.
</p>

<p>
Living alley improvements will be completed in five phases, where small changes may start the process and larger public investments can be made over time. For example, one starting point may be string lighting, seating areas, or greenery. The next step can be features to slow traffic and then road alterations or paving. Although this is a community-based project, ideally beneficial to everybody, it mainly serves people who use the alleys every day. Prioritizing open space near schools and senior centers is given greater importance as these venues offer opportunities for education and community services and programing. While small changes can make a large visual impact, many practical elements must be considered when redesigning an alley, such as hydraulics, road composition, underground utilities, emergency vehicle access, accessibility, parking, traffic, and street crossing, as these elements are important everyday functional public realm components.
</p>

<p>
Design specifications include having an approved list of greenery species to limit plant sizes, water use, and maintenance, plus the suggested use of bollards, chicanes, and sidewalk extensions. Cleanliness and safety can be achieved with lighting, coordinated garbage access, and siting secured enclosures, loading zones or docks, and mechanical rooms. Vibrancy is harder to create but is aided through signage, public art, light strings, and temporary closure during street events. Idealized prototypes for each alley designation (residential, commercial, or mixed use) are key elements of an interpretable, usable Living Alleys plan.

<h3 id="austin">Austin, Texas</h3>

<p>
In 2012, the City of Austin Downtown Commission Alley Activation Workgroup prepared its “Activating Austin’s Downtown Alleys as Public Spaces” report. The City of Austin had previously sold easement rights for some alleys, which were subsequently developed as superblocks, making a connected, walkable downtown center challenging. The workgroup sought to utilize remaining public alleys to extend Austin’s hallmark vibrancy for residents and visitors to enjoy, not just pass through.
</p>

<p>
The plan included preservation of the city’s traditional grid system to enhance the remaining alleys via a master plan, but it started with a pilot activation project called “Alley 111.” Alley 111 was selected as an ideal location based on criteria such as trash pickup and delivery accommodation, business support, and walkability. Physical improvements and cultural programing were initiated in Alley 111, including seating, greenery, and artwork placed so as not to interfere with trash pickup or daily deliveries. The art itself consisted of a peppermint wall mural, bird paintings on the surface pavement, an aerial sculpture made of twine, and paper origami peace crane streamers created by local children. To foster interest early on, diverse events were programmed for audience outreach. Alley 111 had an opening night party, a pop-up commuter breakfast, family day, and a thank-you candlelit dinner celebration for workgroup members and volunteers.
</p>

<p>
The temporary pilot activation was successful, and from this test a set of policy recommendations was drafted to guide future alley activations in the City of Austin. Policies range from physical design elements to downtown plan amendments to programmatic activities geared for small businesses, arts, and tourist uses. Even though the City of Austin already had a detailed downtown plan that encouraged alley improvement, having further clarification on appropriate renovation to serve pedestrian walkways plus new art and small business space is a means to achieve activation. Design and development recommendations range from strategizing a ten-year plan to buildout per a standardized urban design template and developing a dumpster replacement cycle.
</p>

<p>
Programmatic planning was also addressed, identifying the need to re-examine the special event permit process to consider changing requirements to open the venue to more organizations that host varying activities. In addition, development of a mobile application will allow tourists and visitors to better explore the downtown alleys and discover their unique historical and architectural features. To support small businesses, the workgroup recommended creating a grant and a low interest loan program to make it easier for small business startups to locate there. Last, the recommendation for artists and artworks consists of partnering with property owners to ensure installation of both temporary and permanent art in these alleys.

<h3 id="seattle">Seattle, Washington</h3>

<p>
While Austin aims to attract tourists and visitors, Seattle is reviewing its 217,500 square feet of public alleyways as a tool for densification and urban infill because 85% is currently underutilized, an estimate that equates to an increase in downtown area of 50% (Fialko and Hampton 2010). Since Seattle’s alleys are predominantly city-owned secondary circulation lanes for service functions, shortcuts, or back access, everyday functions must be balanced with creating new inviting public places. Gehl Architects (2010) studied 300 neglected alleys as part of its comprehensive city walkability planning effort that envisioned these spaces for retail, restaurants, and offices. This permanent mixed-use urbanscape linked by green, activated alleys supports diversity and walkability and works toward the larger global healthy city initiative.
</p>

<p>
Research entailed classification of alleys according to land use (high- or low-density mixed, nightlife, commercial, multi-family residential, or single-family residential) and suggested suitable improvements to be executed with or without development professionals (Fialko and Hampton 2010). Urban design was context sensitive, recognizing that different alleys cater to different needs, while still stressing the crucial universal requirement for sufficient maintenance to make them inviting spaces that feel safe. In addition, by showcasing hidden alley features (such as unique or historical building facades) or locations where alleys border parks or public art, permeable pavement was matched to create a coherent impression that naturally draws pedestrian exploration.
</p>

<p>
Fialko and Hampton (2010) outlined three approaches to actual alley renovation. First, simple renovation does not require much, if any, professional assistance or budget – entailing only additional lighting, cleanup, and welcoming art/ists. Second, contractual work is necessary for a moderate renovation, including buildings and material changes such as adding permeable pavement, opening buildings to cafes, new seating, and possible event space. Third, substantial renovation is a complete alley redevelopment, including pollution prevention through water-filtering drainage swales to minimize runoff, adding shops, and naming the alley. By assigning place names, an identity is born within the community. This, along with lighting, furniture, permeable paving, facades, canopies, greenery, and signage, creates a place of interest. In addition, making the best use of the maritime climate means substantial rain gardens, flood-friendly hydrophytic vegetation, and fruits/vegetables to purposely attract wildlife, all strengthening the local ecosystem. Success in Seattle can be measured by the desired outcomes - increased walkability and quantified new businesses.
</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>
Researching the conditions in the alleys surrounding California Avenue in Palo Alto, California, is a complex process that requires the use of multiple research methods. The initial research for this project was conducted in the fall of 2015 and methods such as spatial analysis, surveys, and interviews were used to gather the necessary data. The goal of this study was to research the existing conditions of the alleys. Continuing the project, the intent is now to create a design plan. The research methods are therefore adjusted to better serve the new objective.
</p>

<h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3>

<p>
During the initial studies of the alleys around California Avenue, none of the business owners or managers was interviewed. People who work in the offices, restaurants, and retail stores use these alleys more often than others and, therefore, more in-depth interviews were conducted with them for this project. The questions asked in the interviews were open ended. Using this technique, the respondents expressed their opinions in their own words. Rather than choosing from preselected alternatives, as the subjects would if they were filling out a survey, they had the opportunity to express a more nuanced point of view.
</p>

<p>
It is important to have a good introductory question when conducting an interview. This helps the subject concentrate on the theme of the interview. The first question in this case was: “What has been your experience using the alley?” This gave the respondents the opportunity to talk about the issues that bother them and features that work well. The next question asked was: “Does the alley meet your current business needs?” In answer, the respondents could describe any current issues and how they affect the daily routines of their business. Silicon Valley businesses are known to change rapidly and the businesses in my study area might foresee changes in the way they conduct their business. Therefore, I asked the respondents: “What, if any, changes to the alley might better serve your current or planned future business needs?” Respondents who often use the alleys may have suggestions for improvements that are not obvious to someone who does not use the area as often or for the same purpose as the subjects. At this point in the interview, the subjects had had time to consider the project and possible implications it would have on their business. The next question was: “Do you foresee any financial gains or losses with implementation of an activated alleyway project?” California Avenue is one of the downtown areas; however, it is a small community, which is why the respondents were asked: “Are you or your business interested in participating in a City of Palo Alto activated alleyway planning project for California Avenue?” How they would participate was not specified, and most of the respondents wanted to know how they would be expected to participate. To conclude the interview, the subjects were encouraged to: “Please provide any additional information you think might aid our research understanding.” This gave the respondents a chance to comment on any issues that had not yet been mentioned or add information to any of the previous questions they may have thought of during the interview.
</p>

<p>
Interviews were conducted in the month of March 2016. Respondents were approached during regular business hours at a time considered to be off-peak and without appointment. Some of the businesses were too busy to answer the questions, but most were able to combine answering questions with tending to their business. The employees at the business who answered the questions were mostly managers. To get a more varied point of view, business owners was approached for interviews as well.
</p>

<h3 id="3d-modeling">3D Modeling</h3>

<p>
Creating the design sketches and 3D models is important to the project. These visual instruments will help people better understand the intentions of the designs. To design the 3D models of the study area, two software programs were used: Fusion 360 from Autodesk and SketchUp by Trimble Navigation Limited. These are computer-aided design (CAD) software programs that are used to create both 2D and 3D designs. Between the two, I found that they had the features necessary to complete the models.
</p>

<p>
Fusion 360 was used to create the basic models of the buildings with the correct measurements. Correct measurements in the models are crucial for this project and had to be collected manually by using a laser measuring device. The device used was the Bosch GLM 100 C, which can calculate heights using a double indirect height measurement. It calculates heights from two measurements and the corresponding angle between them. Construction of the buildings, which often did not have an overhang to use as an endpoint and did have uneven ground, made collecting these data crucial. Calculating height with this formula meant that windows, or any other elements placed on the building walls, could be measured and their precise placement on the wall could be calculated. The device transfers data via Bluetooth to a mobile application, GLM measure & document. The most effective way to store the measurements is to use the application to take a picture of what is being measured, then employ the user interface to draw the lengths you want to measure. By selecting one length in the application, then using the device to measure the distance, you can transfer the measured value to the application. Data are shown as a number on the image, and several images can be organized in folders representing projects. Each project can be exported and sent via email as a PDF for further use on a computer.
</p>

<p>
The necessary data were entered manually in the modeling software, and the buildings were designed one at a time and laid out to create a model as close to reality as possible. When the designs were completed in Fusion 360, they were uploaded to Autodesk’s A360 cloud service. A360 supports exporting Fusion 360 models to the native SketchUp format (.SKP). Following these steps, the basic models were imported into SketchUp and further developed.
</p>

<p>
SketchUp has many built-in features that make it possible for a person without a graphic design background to create 3D models. SketchUp also has a particularly useful feature called the 3D Warehouse, where any user of the program can download pre-made models of design features such as lighting, furniture, plants, and surface materials. This allows for exploration of multiple designs without having to design every piece from the beginning. Using SketchUp, context was created around the basic model by adding Google Earth footage, then modeling pavement, intersections, and streets.
